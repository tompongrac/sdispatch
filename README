A secure file transfer program that is designed be very flexible in the
way it handles connections. It allows you to operate and take control over
the program to make it do what you need it to do. It is designed to be
more of a 'dumb' tool, but very powerful when configured properly as it
doesn't have to make guesses for you. It allows multiple peers to send
files to each other through a very basic out-of-band protocol. Each file
transfers has configurable connection methods, acquires a peers verdict
and optionally secured with PKI.
