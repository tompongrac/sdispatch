----] 1 - Specific Platform Instructions

See appropriate platform for details.


----] 1.1 Installation from source for Linux

To build:

  $ make -f Makefile.linux

To install:

  # make -f Makefile.linux install

To clean:

  $ make -f Makefile.linux clean

To uninstall:

  # make -f Makefile.linux uninstall

The following files will be (un)installed:

  /usr/bin/sdispatch
  /usr/share/sdispatch/ui.xml
  /etc/sdispatch.conf


----] 1.2 Installation from source for FreeBSD

To build:

  $ gmake -f Makefile.freebsd

To install:

  # gmake -f Makefile.freebsd install

To clean:

  $ gmake -f Makefile.freebsd clean

To uninstall:

  # gmake -f Makefile.freebsd uninstall

The following files will be (un)installed:

  /usr/bin/sdispatch
  /usr/share/sdispatch/ui.xml
  /etc/sdispatch.conf


----] 1.3 Installation from source for Windows

To build:

  For Windows builds I have been using MinGW cross compiler for Linux. If
  you want to compile it as I have you will need to install the following
  development packages into the MinGW environment

    - gtk+2.0
    - openssl

  You will need to set MINGW_LIB_PATH and MINGW_INCLUDE_PATH to the
  appropriate directories in which you installed MinGW for the library path
  and the include path respectfully. You can either do this by manually
  editing the Makefile.win or adding MINGW_LIB_PATH=/path/to/lib to the
  command line argument when issuing make.

  $ make -f Makefile.windows

To install:
  
  You will need to copy all the following files to an empty directory for
  the project

  intl.dll
  jpeg62.dll
  libatk-1.0-0.dll
  libcairo-2.dll
  libeay32.dll
  libgdk-win32-2.0-0.dll
  libgdk_pixbuf-2.0-0.dll
  libgio-2.0-0.dll
  libglib-2.0-0.dll
  libgmodule-2.0-0.dll
  libgobject-2.0-0.dll
  libgthread-2.0-0.dll
  libgtk-win32-2.0-0.dll
  libpango-1.0-0.dll
  libpangocairo-1.0-0.dll
  libpangoft2-1.0-0.dll
  libpangowin32-1.0-0.dll
  libpng12-0.dll
  libssl32.dll
  libtiff3.dll
  zlib1.dll
  build/win32/sdispatch.exe
  build/win32/etc/   (copy whole directory)
  ui.xml
  sdispatch.conf.win

  
  Then rename sdispatch.conf.win to sdispatch.conf
